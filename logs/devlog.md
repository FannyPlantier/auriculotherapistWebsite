Regarding the simplicity, efficiency, and basic functions the therapist wants, and considering current trends, I have decided to create a one-page, long-scrolling website with anchors instead of separate pages.
I will use HTML, possibly JavaScript (only if necessary), and vanilla CSS, or a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap with a purge process to optimize website performance.

I will pay close attention to the website’s ecological impact, focusing on:
- Performance optimization (image formats and sizes, lazy loading, minimal HTTP requests)
- Hosting optimization by selecting a provider that prioritizes sustainability and has local data centers
- Minimalist design, and possibly offering a dark mode
- Ensuring accessibility for all users
- Testing environmental performance of the website


***COLOR PALETTES*** <br>
Based on the color the therapist mentioned she likes, I proposed six palettes for her to choose from.

We worked on the logo and name for her activity. I proposed three logo designs as a starting point for reflection.

She preferred the first one but mentioned that we couldn’t use the word 'thérapie' because she is not a doctor.

Second batch of ideas <br>
