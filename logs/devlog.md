Regarding the simplicity, efficiency, and basic functions the therapist wants, and considering current trends, I have decided to create a one-page, long-scrolling website with anchors instead of separate pages.
I will use HTML, possibly JavaScript (only if necessary), and vanilla CSS, or a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap with a purge process to optimize website performance.

I will pay close attention to the websiteâ€™s ecological impact, focusing on:
- Performance optimization (image formats and sizes, lazy loading, minimal HTTP requests)
- Hosting optimization by selecting a provider that prioritizes sustainability and has local data centers
- Minimalist design, and possibly offering a dark mode
- Ensuring accessibility for all users
- Testing environmental performance of the website
