# Requirements analysis

The website must be simple, efficient and dynamic. 
The therapist wants to:
- Present herself, her professional background and how she came to auriculotherapy
- Describe and present auriculotherapy including some datas about it
- Allow patients to find her (address with map, and contact form)

Of course, the website should be responsive to the device it is viewed on.

She neither needs nor wants to modify the website herself.

One of the colors she wants for the site is a light blue-green (RGB : 184, 222, 217). <br>
I'll work with the palette she chooses from the six I proposed to her.
