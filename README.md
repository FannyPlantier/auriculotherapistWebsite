# Therapist Website project

I've been asked by a friend to create a website for her new activity.
After discussing her requirements for the website (from a functional perspective), I'll write a requirements analysis document, then create a wireframe and possibly a prototype. Finally, I'll code, host, and deploy the complete website.
