Regarding the simplicity, efficiency, and basic functions the therapist wants, and considering current trends, I have decided to create a one-page, long-scrolling website with anchors instead of separate pages.
I will use HTML, vanilla CSS, and JavaScript.
To reduce the ecological impact, I have chosen not to use any frameworks.
